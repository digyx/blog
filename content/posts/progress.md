These are all codenames for the project and not the actual title.  Some short stories share the same codename and title, but most longer projects won't.  I'll try to update this every Sunday, but that's not a guarantee.

| Name        | Phase       | Progress          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Azure Witch | Final Draft | 40 / 114 pages    |
| Etherborn   | Outline     | 25%               |
| Voidling    | First Draft | 26 pages (hiatus) |

### 2022-05-15

Ah, this week hasn't been my most productive, but I've been moving forward.  I have a trip to Nova Scotia lasting until June, so I'll have more free time to work on Azure Witch and Etherborn.  My hope is to have Azure Witch completely done by June and to be started on Etherborn.  I'm putting Voidling on hiatus since I'm not sure where I want to take it.  I didn't write an outline, or even a rough idea, before starting it, and that's biting me in the ass now.  Either way, there will defintiely be a short story release in July.  I'm taking May to focus on Azure Witch, so that means none in May or June, unless I pump something out super quick (but I wouldn't trust the end result).
