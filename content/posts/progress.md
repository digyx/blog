These are all codenames for the project and not the actual title.  Some short stories share the same codename and title, but most longer projects won't.  I'll try to update this every Sunday, but that's not a guarantee.

| Name                 | Phase       | Progress          |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Azure Witch          | Final Draft | 118 / 125 pages   |
| Etherborn            | Outline     | 80%               |
| Voidling             | First Draft | 26 pages (hiatus) |

I wonder how many other people struggle with anticipatory anxiety as much as I do.  The hardest part about writing for me is the moment before I start.  I have my music and "spot" to make it easier to get into the mood and eventually the flow, but actually starting is still incredibly difficult for me.  Writing new material has much leess anxiety for me since I know that I can fix my mistakes in the editing stage, but then I freeze during the editing stage.  Seven pages remaining.  Seven.  That's a small number.  I can honestly finish that right now and by asleep by midnight (currently 10:30PM).  But what does that mean?  I finish the edit, send it off to my girlfriend for a lookover, throw it into ProWritingAid to catch any obvious mistakes that fell through the cracks, and do my final read through, and then publish it.  That's it.  It's done at that point.  What if it's bad?  It might be.  It probably will be when compared to Brandon Sanderson or Helen Scheuerer.  Is that okay?  Can I justify charging people $3 for something that might be bad?

These are the thoughts I'm struggling with.  They're things I keep thinking I've already worked through, but they're obviously not.  The only way to work through them is to actually do them.  I can tell myself as many "if x happens, then y" but I won't actually prove to myself that "y" will happen until I do "x".  In other words, I'm finishing the final edit tonight and tomorrow.

Anyway, Etherborn is going pretty well.  I haven't been writing for the past few months since my brain has said "well, we have to focus on finishing Azure Witch first" but I've recently gotten over that mental block, so I've written a few thousand words for Etherborn this past week as a way to decompress.  The outline is coming together in my mind, but it's not quite there yet.  A few important bits of glue are still missing.  During the writing phase, I've decided to write it non-linearly, so right now I have about ~2k words done of onf ot he final chapters while also having ~3k words done of the first chapter.  Overall, I think that's around 5% of the first draft.  This one will be a full fledged novel.

It's been a while.  No ETA on Azure Witch as I've learned that deadlines and I do not mix.  Instead of aiming for a date, I'm aiming to edit at least one page a day.  Yes, this does imply a maximum possible deadline, but I'm going to pretend that it doesn't.  To lessen my cognitive load even more, I'm also suspending the concept of monthly short stories until I have a writing routine stabilized.

Work has been done on Etherborn, and I expect next week to have even more progress made.  The outline phase is strange for me since I'm usually a [pantser](https://whenyouwrite.com/plotter-vs-pantser/), but I've found that having an outline allows me to write faster and without fear.  The lack of guard rails I had for Azure Witch definitely played a part in my anxiety surrounding the final edit.

Anyhow, see y'all on Sunday.

### 2022-06-28

Today is Tuesday, and Azure Witch will be uploaded to the website by Thursday evening for a midnight UTC release.

I'll put it up on Amazon for purchase ($3) sometime Friday.

All that's remaining are 22 pages, the grammar edit, and the final read through.  I understand that very few (if any) people will read this and that these little apragraphs are mostly me talking to myself, but that's alright.  I understand that I'm not a big name author who really anyone cares about, but that's alright.  I use this space as more a space to reflect on me and my behaviour.  The biggest issue I've had editing Azure Witch is just getting started and understanding that any progress is better than no progress.  I set these lofty goals for myself then fail when life comes and slaps me in the face.  Just editing a page a day is sufficient, especially if I only plan on releasing one book a year, and most of those days will result in editing five, ten, or even twenty pages instead.  Today and tomorrow will probably be the last time I edit v1 of Azure Witch, and then Thursday morning will consist of ePub formatting and uploading for release.  I do have to boot up my Windows VM to format the Kindle release since I use Linux, though.

### 2022-06-19

Alright, this count doesn't include any editing I'm doing today.  Along with the additional 22 pages I edited (also finally started to include the front matter in the done count), I wrote a nine page epilogue as well.  Before, the story ended abruptly, but this will tie up a fair bit of loose ends while also giving me a lot of room to branch off into another story.  Right now, I'm feeling pretty confident that I'll have the book done by next Sunday.  My schedule is pretty clear for the upcoming week, and my editing speed has literally doubled in the past few days.  Turns out that editing fight scenes is a *lot* slower than dialogue.

No progress updates on Etherborn or Voidling, but the short story to be released on July 15th is mostly planned in my noggin.  Imma overrule my previous decision and start including the short story in the chart.

### 2022-06-12

Hey, today's Sunday!  Anyway, I edited 8.5 pages today.  I think I may have found a good system for editing, though I'm not sure I can do it during the week.  It interferes with previous commitments and my existing workouts.  I'll try to adjust.  Editing felt great, and I like where the story is at so far.  I still think the final fight needs some additions (like tripled in size), and that will take a bit of time on my end.  I won't mkae any commitments except a release date on July 1st.

### 2022-06-07

*whistles nervously*

Azure Witch release date pushed back to July 1st.  No excuses to be made; depression has just been hitting me harder than I previously expected.  I'm solidifying what causes these slumps and what brings me out of them, so I'll hopefully be more engaged this month.

In other news, a staggering amount of Etherborn has been planned.  The magic system used in it has gone through its sixth (I think) iteration, and I'm really happy with where it's at.  I expect there to be some minor changes, but I love the new strucute.  This has been the main thing holding me back as I was struggling with what abilites one side character will have.  Since this is no longer an issue, I have a good feeling about the amount of progress I'll make on the outline.

I do plan on releasing a short story in July as well.  This one will be a continuation of Blood Oath and set several months afterwards.  Asigor and Olivia will be returning, and I've been noodling around with that plot in my noggin.  I won't add it to the progress chart as short stories have a very tight turn around for me.  I wrote Blood Oath in three days and edited it in four (with a few months in between).

### 2022-05-22

Let's pretend today's Sunday.

I haven't done much work on Azure Witch in the past week, but I've been doing a fair bit of work on Etherborn.  At this point, I'm about halfway done with outlining the A plot and a quarter of the way done designing the B plot.  I've narrowed down who the main characters will be, the main conflict, and what the climax will be, but there are still a fair amount of details left for me to figure out.  Actually, I have about 14 pages of Etherborn written (all of the prologue and a little under half of chapter one).  Azure Witch will be taking most of my focus this week, though, as I'd like to release it on June 1st still.  It's seeming less likely, but I won't give up.  Just gotta pop in some music and fall into the flow state for a few hours each day.  Seventy pages is a lot, but it's not an impossible amount.  Worst case scenario, I don't mind pushing the date back once more.  As long as I keep making progress, I'll be happy.

### 2022-05-15

Ah, this week hasn't been my most productive, but I've been moving forward.  I have a trip to Nova Scotia lasting until June, so I'll have more free time to work on Azure Witch and Etherborn.  My hope is to have Azure Witch completely done by June and to be started on Etherborn.  I'm putting Voidling on hiatus since I'm not sure where I want to take it.  I didn't write an outline, or even a rough idea, before starting it, and that's biting me in the ass now.  Either way, there will defintiely be a short story release in July.  I'm taking May to focus on Azure Witch, so that means none in May or June, unless I pump something out super quick (but I wouldn't trust the end result).
