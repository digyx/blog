These are all codenames for the project and not the actual title.  Some short stories share the same codename and title, but most longer projects won't.  I'll try to update this every Sunday, but that's not a guarantee.

| Name        | Phase       | Progress          |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Azure Witch | Final Draft | 41 / 114 pages    |
| Etherborn   | Outline     | 50%               |
| Voidling    | First Draft | 26 pages (hiatus) |

*whistles nervously*

Azure Witch release date pushed back to July 1st.  No excuses to be made; depression has just been hitting me harder than I previously expected.  I'm solidifying what causes these slumps and what brings me out of them, so I'll hopefully be more engaged this month.

In other news, a staggering amount of Etherborn has been planned.  The magic system used in it has gone through its sixth (I think) iteration, and I'm really happy with where it's at.  I expect there to be some minor changes, but I love the new strucute.  This has been the main thing holding me back as I was struggling with what abilites one side character will have.  Since this is no longer an issue, I have a good feeling about the amount of progress I'll make on the outline.

I do plan on releasing a short story in July as well.  This one will be a continuation of Blood Oath and set several months afterwards.  Asigor and Olivia will be returning, and I've been noodling around with that plot in my noggin.  I won't add it to the progress chart as short stories have a very tight turn around for me.  I wrote Blood Oath in three days and edited it in four (with a few months in between).

Let's pretend today's Sunday.

I haven't done much work on Azure Witch in the past week, but I've been doing a fair bit of work on Etherborn.  At this point, I'm about halfway done with outlining the A plot and a quarter of the way done designing the B plot.  I've narrowed down who the main characters will be, the main conflict, and what the climax will be, but there are still a fair amount of details left for me to figure out.  Actually, I have about 14 pages of Etherborn written (all of the prologue and a little under half of chapter one).  Azure Witch will be taking most of my focus this week, though, as I'd like to release it on June 1st still.  It's seeming less likely, but I won't give up.  Just gotta pop in some music and fall into the flow state for a few hours each day.  Seventy pages is a lot, but it's not an impossible amount.  Worst case scenario, I don't mind pushing the date back once more.  As long as I keep making progress, I'll be happy.

Ah, this week hasn't been my most productive, but I've been moving forward.  I have a trip to Nova Scotia lasting until June, so I'll have more free time to work on Azure Witch and Etherborn.  My hope is to have Azure Witch completely done by June and to be started on Etherborn.  I'm putting Voidling on hiatus since I'm not sure where I want to take it.  I didn't write an outline, or even a rough idea, before starting it, and that's biting me in the ass now.  Either way, there will defintiely be a short story release in July.  I'm taking May to focus on Azure Witch, so that means none in May or June, unless I pump something out super quick (but I wouldn't trust the end result).
